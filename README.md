# SFML Visual Studio Template

This is a project template for Visual Studio using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library.
The different required files for SFML are put into the Dependencies folder.
If you want to jump right into visual studio, I have done the configuration for you. 
You might have to switch from x64 to x86 in visual studio.
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me s.raouf@student.isartdigital.com
